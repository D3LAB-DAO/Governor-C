# Ordinary Voting

> One-to-One

Everyone equally has only one vote.

However, in this way, it is simply determined by a majority vote, and there is no way to reflect an individual's desperation because they have same voting power.

# One-person Multi-vote Method

> One-to-Many

To overcome these shortcomings, a one-person multi-vote method has been proposed that allows them to have as many votes as they paid,

but there is a problem here that a small number of wealthy participants can decide the result of the voting easily.

# Quadratic Voting (QV)

> One-to-Many, Suppressed

To solve this problem, a quadratic voting method is presented in which the cost of purchasing votes increases exponentially.

However, there is a limitation that quadratic voting is vulnerable to **sybil attacks**, and it is also challenging to establish a secure system that guarantees anonymity and integrity apart from the quadratic voting protocol.

# Probabilistic Quadratic Voting (PQV)

> One-to-Many, Suppressed, and Probabilistic

We introduce a secure voting system through **Probabilistic Quadratic Voting (PQV)** and show that the system can keep the value of existing quadratic voting methods.
