# Probabilistic Quadratic Voting

> [*Junmo Lee, Sanghyeon Park, and Soo-Mook Moon. "Secure Voting System with Sybil Attack Resistance using Probabilistic Quadratic Voting and Trusted Execution Environment."

### Ordinary Voting (One-to-One)

In an ordinary voting method, everyone equally has only one vote. However, in this way, it is simply determined by a majority vote, and there is no way to reflect an individual's desperation because they have same voting power.

### One-person Multi-vote Method (One-to-Many)

To overcome these shortcomings, a one-person multi-vote method has been proposed that allows them to have as many votes as they paid, but there is a problem here that a small number of wealthy participants can decide the result of the voting easily.

### Quadratic Voting (QV)

To solve this problem, a quadratic voting method is presented in which the cost of purchasing votes increases exponentially. However, there is a limitation that quadratic voting is vulnerable to **sybil attacks**, and it is also challenging to establish a secure system that guarantees anonymity and integrity apart from the quadratic voting protocol.

### Probabilistic Quadratic Voting (PQV)

We introduce a secure voting system through **Probabilistic Quadratic Voting (PQV)** and show that the system can keep the value of existing quadratic voting methods.
